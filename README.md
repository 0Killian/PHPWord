PHPWord is a library written in pure PHP that provides a set of classes to write to and read from different document file formats. The current version of PHPWord supports Microsoft [Office Open XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) (OOXML or OpenXML), OASIS [Open Document Format for Office Applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) (OpenDocument or ODF), and [Rich Text Format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format) (RTF).

* Insert paragraphs, either as a simple text or complex one (a text run) that contains other elements
* Insert titles (headers) and table of contents

* Insert and format images, either local, remote, or as page watermarks
