by downloading the library.

``composer.json``:

    {
        "require": {
           "phpoffice/phpword": "dev-master"
        }

To install manually, `download PHPWord package from github`_. Extract
the package and put the contents to your machine. To use the library,
include ``Classes/PHPWord.php`` in your script like below.

After installation, you can browse and use the samples that weâ€™ve
provided, either by command line or using browser. If you can access
your PHPWord library folder using browser, point your browser to the
``samples`` folder, e.g. ``http://localhost/PHPWord/samples/``.
